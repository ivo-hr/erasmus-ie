## Team Collection

Each document in the "Team" collection has the following structure:

```json
{
    "Team_Name": "TeamName",  // Name of the swimming team
    "Swims": [
        {
            "Event_Name": "EventName",  // Name of the swimming event
            "Event_description": "EventDescription",  // Description of the swimming event
            "Athlete_Full_Name": "AthleteName",  // Full name of the athlete
            "Gender": "Male/Female",  // Gender of the athlete
            "Athlete_birth_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",  // Birth date of the athlete
            "Swim_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",  // Date of the swim
            "Team_Code": "TeamCode",  // Code of the team
            "Rank_Order": "RankOrder",  // Rank order of the swim
            "City": "CityName",  // Name of the city
            "Country_Code": "CountryCode",  // Code of the country
            "Duration": "hh:mm:ss:ff"  // Duration of the swim
        },
        // Additional swim entries for the same team
        // ...
    ]
}


Each document contains information about a specific swimming team, 
including an array of swims associated with that team. 
The "Swims" array includes details about each swim, such as the event name, 
athlete information, swim date, team code, rank order, city name, country code, 
and the duration of the swim. 
The code ensures that each unique team gets its own document in the "Team" collection.
